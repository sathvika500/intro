<h2>Jawaharlal Nehru served as the first Prime Minister of India from August 15, 1947, until his death on May 27, 1964. His tenure spanned over 16 years, marked by his visionary leadership, commitment to secularism, and promotion of democratic values. Nehru played a pivotal role in shaping India's post-independence policies, focusing on industrialization, education, and social reforms. His emphasis on non-alignment in foreign policy established India as a prominent voice in global affairs. Despite facing challenges, Nehru's legacy endures as a foundational figure in modern India's history.</h2>

<h2>Lal Bahadur Shastri, India's second Prime Minister, served from 1964 to 1966. Notable for leading India during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, he coined the slogan "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" (Hail the soldier, Hail the farmer) to boost morale. Shastri aimed to enhance India's self-sufficiency in food production. Tragically, he passed away under mysterious circumstances in Tashkent on January 11, 1966, shortly after signing the Tashkent Agreement to end the war with Pakistan.</h2>
